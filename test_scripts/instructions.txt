       BerryClip - 6 LED Board

--------------------------------------

The BerryClip is a simple, cheap and easy to use add-on board for the Raspberry Pi. It plugs 
directly onto the Pi's GPIO header and provides 6 coloured LEDs, 1 Buzzer and 1 Switch. It
can be controlled using any programming language that can manipulate the GPIO pins.

Assembly Instructions
=============================

The kit includes the following parts :

- 1 PCB
- 1 26-way header
- 2 Red LEDs
- 2 Orange LEDs
- 2 Yellow LEDs
- 1 Buzzer
- 1 Switch
- 6 330 ohm resistors
- 1 1K ohm resistor
- 1 10K ohm resistor

The PCB is labelled to identify where each component should be placed.

P1     : 26-way header
Buzz1  : 5v buzzer
S1     : Micro-switch
R1-R6  : 330 ohm (Orange-Orange-Brown)
R7     : 1K ohm (Brown-Black-Red)
R8     : 10K ohm (Brown-Black-Orange)
LED1,2 : Red LEDs (3 marks)
LED3,4 : Orange LEDs (2 marks)
LED5,6 : Yellow LEDs (no marks)

Take care to ensure the 1K and 10K resistors are placed in the correct positions. Obviously you can arrange the LEDs in any order you prefer.

If you have never soldered before or you need a quick refresher then I can recommend the "Soldering Is Easy" comic :
http://mightyohm.com/files/soldercomic/FullSolderComic_EN.pdf

or this SparkFun page :
http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/106

Recommended Soldering Sequence :
 - Solder 8 resistors
 - Solder 6 LEDs
 - Solder 1 switch
 - Solder 1 buzzer
 - Solder 1 26-way header

Once the components are soldered :
 - Visually check your solder joints and ensure there are no stray blobs or splashes of solder that might short-circuit any pins.
 - Remove the label on the buzzer.
 - Stick rubber bumper to underside of board so it will rest on large silver capacitor (C6) on the Raspberry Pi.

Plug the board onto your Raspberry Pi. Stand back and admire your work.

Raspberry Pi Setup
=============================

Prepare Raspbian image using official download from raspberrypi.org

Boot Pi and login with default username and password ('pi' and 'raspberry')

You will now be located in the 'pi' user home directory ('/home/pi/').

Type the following commands where [ENTER] means press the Enter key :

  mkdir berryclip [ENTER]
  cd berryclip [ENTER]
  wget http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/berryclip/6_led/install.sh [ENTER]
  sh install.sh [ENTER]

The above lines perform the following functions :
  - Make a new directory called 'berryclip'
  - Move into that directory
  - Grab a script from the website
  - Run the script

The script will download an instruction file and a set of example Python scripts.

Type :

  ls [ENTER]

to list the downloaded files.


Run Some Example Scripts
=============================

berryclip_01.py - Test LEDs only
berryclip_02.py - Test Buzzer only
berryclip_03.py - Test Switch only
berryclip_04.py - Test LEDs and Switch
berryclip_05.py - Test LEDs, Buzzer and Switch
berryclip_06.py - LED sequence
berryclip_07.py - Dice Simulator
berryclip_08.py - Reaction time game
berryclip_09.py - Random LEDs

To run a script you can use the following command :

  sudo python berryclip_01.py [ENTER]

To quit a running Python script use [CTRL-C].

To view a text file or Python script you can use the command :

  cat berryclip_01.py


Other Useful Linux Commands
=============================

To list the files in the current directory use :

  ls [ENTER]

To list the files in the current directory in columns use :

  ls -l [ENTER]

To edit a script use :

  nano berryclip_01.py [ENTER]

to save changes and quit use [CTRL-X], then [Y] then [ENTER]

To copy a script to a new filename use :

  cp berryclip_01.py my_first_script.py

To reboot the Pi :

  sudo reboot [ENTER]

To shutdown the Pi :

  sudo halt [ENTER]

and wait for the lights on the Pi to stop changing (usually about 20 seconds) before removing the power cable.

If you are using Putty on another computer to access your Pi over a network without a monitor attached you can cut-n-paste these commands. Select the command, copy and use a right-mouse click in Putty to insert the command onto the command line.
