BerryClip and Wiimote
=====================
<pre>
Run the 4 installation scripts

The 'test' script reads all the button presses on the Wiimote and is taken from Matt Hawkins' Raspberry Pi Spy website www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk

The wii_berryclip.py script allows you to 'control' your BerryClip with a Wiimote. The script is adapted from the test script.

To run either of these scripts...
	python <name of script file>
	e.g. python wii_berryclip.py
</pre>
